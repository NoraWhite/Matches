I was in a hurry to upload this, So i fixed my own errors $ where supposed to be . and the Copyright issue 
there isnt any copyright. So your all free to edit and claim it as your own.

One thing i would like to point out is galileo paradox may come into play.

Another is that when the math is right and the col are counted downward it produces the next 
frame and it can be played like a flip book.

When computing this the next frame down and acrossed appears to be 3 views to an object.

I belive that this might accually be a derivative of a 2-bit cubic retaining device produce by someone who had a few 
other skills of-hand so many hundreds of years ago.

And at last iv written the whole script by hand and is original, It was contemplative for about 3 years. 
I had put forth a bit of though into this formula and had progressed more in mind then on paper and other 
forms of computational means.

Note: Im Not a Professional coder and my grammer is unfair.
