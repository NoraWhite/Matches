I was in a hurry to upload this, So i fixed my own errors $ where supposed to be . and the Copyright issue 
there isnt any copyright so your all free to edit and claim it as your own.

One thing i would like to point out is galileo paradox may come into play.

Another is that when the math is right and the col are counted downward it produces the next 
frame and it can be played like a flip book.

When computing this the next frame down and acrossed appears to be 3 views to an object.

i belive that this might accually be a derivative of a 2-bit retaining device produce by someone who had a few 
other skills of-hand hundreds of years old.

And at last iv written the whole script by hand and is original put a bit of though into it and had 
progressed more in mind then on paper and other forms of computational means.
